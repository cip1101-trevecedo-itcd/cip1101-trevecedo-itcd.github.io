                <p><blockquote><dd>Year (2002) where I was born in <b>Cabanatuan city, Nueva Ecija</b>. My parents were as happy as they can be since their <b>second child</b> is a boy.<sup>(1)</sup> Year (2003) I learned to walk as much as I can hug my family tightly, that it makes them happy every time I do.<sup>(2)</sup> Year (2005) Oh blissful memories I remember, playing, jumping, crying and loving such are the feelings that makes a house, home.<sup>(3)</sup> Year (2008) My first day of school!!, I was so happy that I get to meet other children that are the same age as me.<sup>(4)</sup> I got new friends, we talk about crazy stuff like we thought that rain comes from angels that are peeing through the sky, disgusting but those are merely the <em>innocent imagination of youth</em>.<sup>(5)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>Year (2008) oh caught you off guard, time didn’t really move for me back then, I only remember watching T.V with my sister when my father was acting strange saying things I couldn’t remember, next thing happened I found myself in a <b>broken family</b>.<sup>(6)</sup> My mother crying like she didn’t do anything like it was my father’s fault, crazy adults huh.<sup>(7)</sup> But to be honest I didn’t really hate them, if they aren’t happy being together then just go separate ways, it’s not like it will affect their children right.<sup>(8)</sup> I just wish it didn’t affect their children.<sup>(9)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>Year (2009) <b>I’m now living with my grandma, sister, uncle and my mother</b>.<sup>(10)</sup> We live in a small house in a subdivision where good things happen at least in my memories.<sup>(11)</sup> Year (2009) I started second grade middle school, I am <b>studying in a private school</b>, kids there are rich as hell, while I don’t really envy them, I just wish that I could have what they have someday.<sup>(12)</sup> Year (2010) <em>I love this year</em>, this was the year I met my childhood crush her name is angel, little did she know well, I think she really is an angel; she is also my <b>first close friend</b>.<sup>(13)</sup> I met her when I was looking around then there was this girl, she’s so energetic yet her face remains as beautiful as her movements, she sat 2 chairs aways from me, but hey those aren’t going to stop me.<sup>(14)</sup> Recess time I had a chance to talk to her but you know I couldn't find the words; I couldn't think of what to say and all that I can do is stop and think about the day.<sup>(15)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>Year (2011) This time I had a squad if that’s what they call it, but it’s a circle of friends nothing really happened much in this year that is worth mentioning.<sup>(16)</sup>  Year (2012) Grade five, I couldn’t stop thinking about angel even after all those years she’s still her <em>(most beautiful person in his eyes)</em>, This time something happened between us that I couldn’t forget, she taught me how to ride a bike, we’re friends so it’s pretty normal, but to me if memories can be treasured then I’ll treasure this as long as I’m breathing.<sup>(17)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>After all the riding we have done, well we’re tired sat somewhere where we can see the ground below us.<sup>(18)</sup> Breathing hard she spoke something, she tells me that we’re like siblings, she wished that we don’t go separate ways after graduating grade school, well I wish that too, I even wish for her to only look at me and me alone but things does not go the way you like and that’s sad.<sup>(19)</sup> Year (2013) We graduated, my grandma is with me, I’m standing in front like everybody else, those kids are crying while me I don’t really feel like crying.<sup>(20)</sup> But deep inside I was the saddest person out there.<sup>(21)</sup> I didn’t really have the chance to meet her one last time I just thought that <em>(When all we used to dream about was meeting after school, and we would go on home and start right back again)</em> but really, I was just ashamed that I broke our promise back then that we will still be together after graduating.<sup>(22)</dd></sup></blockquote></p>

                <p><blockquote><dd>Year (2014), Today I’m 12 years old about to go 13 years old, I’m now <b>studying at manila</b> with my sister and father.<sup>(1)</sup> My grandma was very sad that we have to live not around her anymore, I was sad as well.<sup>(2)</sup> And all the things that are unsaid should be left unsaid as I move on with my life, cleared eye.<sup>(3)</sup> Year (2015) 2<sup>nd</sup> year of high school, I started playing as the school’s <b>chess participant</b> didn’t really enjoy that much, I just like playing chess but I don’t have any dreams about being a professional chess player.<sup>(4)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>Year (2016) 3<sup>rd</sup> year of high school, this time I get to feel the feeling of falling in love again, her name is Ericka she sat beside me and she is a transfer student.<sup>(5)</sup> In the four-sided room I could feel the temperature getting lower and lower while she is checking my sketch pad, telling things that I couldn’t clearly hear, it’s just that she looks so clear and beautiful, I was clearly thinking of nothing.<sup>(6)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>Days goes by like the wind, fast yet you feel the breeze once in a while, it makes your skin tingle and it’s annoying.<sup>(7)</sup> During this year (2016) I joined a different club, it was <b>math club</b> I personally don’t like math but I still ended up there due to my curiosity<sup>(8)</sup>. I was accompanied by my friends that is also curious about the club, while not knowing that the professor that are waiting for us there is known to be a chick strict as hell.<sup>(9)</sup> We arrived at the club, sat at the nearby chair and sit beside each other that was our plan, to lessen the terror.<sup>(10)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>Eventually the professor arrived and surprisingly we have seen another side of her.<sup>(11)</sup> She was actually kind of caring motherly like figure outside of teaching and lecturing.<sup>(12)</sup> That time it teaches me that not everything you thought is what they are actually like sometimes it’s just the other side of the coin.<sup>(13)</sup> Year (2017) 10<sup>th</sup> grade this year felt like it was rushed or maybe because most of the time I was busy as hell.<sup>(14)</sup> All of my classmates ran through here and there, like there is a zombie apocalypse, honestly you can’t talk to anybody that time, everybody is just busy well I am too so I’ll cut this short.<sup>(15)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>After some time, we <b>graduated</b> but it’s not that grand or emotional since all of us will stay in the school and not enroll to other school which makes me kind of happy.<sup>(16)</sup> After some time, we have the chance to take it easy once in a while, it was the day for our <b>prom night</b>.<sup>(17)</sup> I was very excited to look cool and neat once in a while since <em>I’m not really that kind of guy that looks cool in school uniforms</em>.<sup>(18)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>Honestly the thing that I’m most excited is to see her in such a beautiful woven dress that makes it look like it was made for her, eyes shining like it was made of diamond or maybe it is, well just kidding.<sup>(19)</sup> After that night me and my friends hit the bar well we look much older for our age that’s why we get a free pass, but it wasn’t that kind of bar it’s just a simple bar.<sup>(20)</sup> That night I was thinking, in this starry night my teenage years would probably come into a pass that I need to focus in school more and much more, but <em>if pretending to know was childish and pretending not to know was adult, then I thought that I was still probably just a child.</em><sup>(21)</dd></sup><blockquote></p>

                <p><blockquote><dd>Year (2021) first year of college, it was really hard to choose which college I should choose, there was a lot of things I should consider.<sup>(1)</sup> Those things are <em>how much the school would cost</em>, well even if I like this school there was no way I could get in considering the amount of money needed for me to study there, so pricey schools are a no.<sup>(2)</sup> Next is <em>how far the university is</em>, it should only be as far as one to two jeepney rides, so it will not be such a hassle going to school.<sup>(3)</sup> Lastly is the <em>quality of teaching</em>, universities have different quality of teaching depending on the course.<sup>(4)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>So, considering these 3 factors I ended up applying for <b>"University of the East"</b> also I’m not that knowledgeable to be able to apply for schools like <b>UP</b>, I already tried though but didn’t get the cut.<sup>(5)</sup> Year (2021) august <em>my first day of college</em> is about to start, I’m really nervous since I’m not really attractive and it’s annoying to open my camera well it’s not like they care to whatever I look but still.<sup>(6)</sup> So, then it started I met a number of <b>good friends</b> they really are good to have by my side not only they help me at academic but also helps me to get by this new environment I have settled myself in.<sup>(7)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>I started the year very normal, like a normal college student I have to <em>juggle my time between school and personal life</em> more deliberate so that I won’t diverge to a stressful schedule.<sup>(8)</sup> These times I don’t really have much time of falling in love like I do back then since all of them does not really end well, but I can’t lie to myself that Ericka is still part of my mind but she is not my priority anymore, I have to carry on and <b>focus on my life instead</b> (well that’s what I think).<sup>(9)</sup>  Year (2021) Midyear I’m starting to think that being an <em>IT is really one of the best things that have happened to my life</em> well that’s what I thought.<sup>(10)</sup> School year was about to end and I think that I got very good grades and eventually I was able to be part of the scholars.<sup>(11)</sup> Well, I was <b>part of the scholars</b> not because I was so intelligent well, I’m average but also, it’s because some of my friends help me as well.<sup>(12)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>Year (2021) It’s the <em>beginning of a new chapter</em> which is my 2<sup>nd</sup> year college well it’s still not done yet but there are a couple of things that already happened.<sup>(13)</sup> For instance I was able to dodge professors that I don’t like well it’s not that they are bad professors, but they are not good for my mental health so as much as possible I try to dodge them.<sup>(14)</sup> Still the same year (2021) things are a bit better we started second semester as normal as any semester, but the <em>usual me seems to be a bit gone</em>.<sup>(15)</sup> Since my <b>grandmother passed away</b>, accomplishments in school doesn’t feel the same way because my grandma wasn’t there to congratulate me and be happy since back then I wasn’t really an achiever and to her every achievement I make is a core memory and I love that.<sup>(16)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>Nights seems a little bit longer maybe a little bit cold as well, I think it’s 3am in the morning I rode my bike packing stuff that I think I might need, In the road or in the bed either way it does not change the fact that I keep thinking of my grandma I just love her so much that a part of me has to go.<sup>(17)</sup> Knees tired and my face is as red as an apple, I rest beside a tree it’s shadow seems to be talking to me telling me things that I already know, in fact that day I thought that my old life was probably the part that left me.<sup>(18)</dd></sup><br><br> <dd>Mid (2021) oh the cold days, pandemic is still at its peak, its starting to feel like it’s already a part of the world ha what am I thinking of course eventually it would have an end just like everything else.<sup>(19)</sup> We studied a new programming language it’s called java well we studied it last year as well but today we learned quite a couple of new things.<sup>(20)</sup> Time pass by and today we are at the end of our first semester, it was very tiring to the point that most of us probably have a point in which they started having breakdowns, oh you ask me? Well fortunately I didn’t have any breakdowns of some sort.<sup>(21)</sup> <u>To summarize we did a lot of things we made a game, software’s and a lot of interesting things</u>.<sup>(22)</sup> Fast forward, end of the year it was about to turn 2022 maybe 5 minutes before 2022 I don’t really care much all I care is that I’m about to leave the feelings that must be left behind this year, huh what am I thinking changing of years doesn’t change the fact that all that happened to me did affect me in some sort of way, year changing doesn’t really means to start a new, to me what it meant is too look back all the things that has happened that makes me who am I today.<sup>(23)</dd></sup></blockquote></p>
