Frontman Gerard Way explained the lyrical meaning, saying, <i>"It's about being dead and about people not liking you </i> - it was a commentary on the band and how some people feel about us. We wanted to say, 'You may hate us but we're still here.' We wanted to say, 'Here we are, and we're better. Here we are and we're more daring and defiant than ever."</p>

The album is consist of 5 music that talks about different times of relationship which is very good for people that is starting they relationship to better understand each other. First coming across the duo during recent travels through Europe, their music struck a chord rather immediately. Having wanted to find some music that stuck out amid all the noise without being forceful itself, Honeywater’s self-titled debut did just that: four songs of beautifully crafted folk music displaying solid potential. The songs are simple and well within the genre, but there’s a purity and bitter sweetness behind some of the material that had me initially assuming this was an offering from an older act, further along in their career</p>

    <p align="left"> This particular song is called <b>sleep on the floor</b> which was released in 2016 and is part of the album called <b>cleopatra</b>. In an interview at the iHeartRadio Concert, the band explained the song a little:It's just about, I think, [how] people move to big cities, whether it's New York or LA, certain cities have these promises implied. You're gonna go there, and you're gonna fulfill that promise, you're gonna catch that dream that you had in your head. And when you go there and it doesn't happen, that's sort of a reaction to that. It was kind of interesting to go to Denver of all places, and that's where we finally started getting some movement, or some traction, and we began to tour as a real band would. And I found that there was so much restriction in these expensive cities, it kind of kills your artistry. If you're trying to do what we were trying to do, which was tour a lot.</p>
