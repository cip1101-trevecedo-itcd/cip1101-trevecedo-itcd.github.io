    <h1>BUCKET LIST</h1>

    <br>

    <p>You know I've been thinking of what I should do before I kick the bucket. Maybe I should come over to my girlfriends house and get her around the city, she always had this adventurous trait. But you know not everybody had the capacity or money to even fulfill these bucket of list even if I write all this down will i ever be able to do it. You see it doesn't even matter if I'd be able to do it or not what matters is that your imagination while writing this down can get you excited in life and yearn more for yourself and for your love ones.</p>
